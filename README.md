A collection of different projects that I've worked on in the past, whether for assignments or an idea that popped into my head.

Fare.py:
Using a large data set collected from New York City taxi cabs I wanted to see whether I could create a fare predictor using a restricted amount
of input information. Unfortunately the data I restricted the model to using was not a good estimator of potential fares and thus the project
ended up making a generalized guess that anywhere would likely give the average fare of New York City.

Raytracer.cpp:
Utilizing the OpenGL library I utilized physics formula to simulate the interaction between light and objects of different materials to
have an accurate depiction of the lights behavior. A few passes have created adjustments that have optimized the time it takes to render
a frame as well as mimic the behavior of refraction, something that has caused trouble for some time. Though refraction is not functional
it looks the closest to how it should look now as opposed to how it functioned previously showing no distortion.

SquareSum.cpp:
Utilizing data structures and std Vectors I created a program that could find solutions for the Square Sum problem given an integer.
The Square Sum problem states that you are given a sequence of numbers 1 to n and must arrange them such that each pair of neighboring
numbers add up to a perfect square. For example, 3 and 1 since they add to 4, and 1 and 8 since they add to 9. So 3, 1, 8 would be a 
valid portion of a larger sequence.
